1. To re-create MemeMaker database just use Restore Database tool from SQL Server Management Studio and use 'Database\MemeMakerDB.bak' file.

2. Copy 'Memes' and 'Templates' folders on your C:\\ drive. You can place them in different location - in that case you need to edit 'appsettings.json' file and change values of 'TemplateRootPath' and 'MemeRootPath'.
